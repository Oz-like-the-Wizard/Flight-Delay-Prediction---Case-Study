# Flight Delay Prediction - Case-Study
A case study on Kaggle's flight delay prediction dataset

This repository contains my take on Kaggle's flight delay prediction challange. The full dataset can be found here:

The purpose is not to obtain the best possible prediction but rather to emphasize on the various steps needed to build such a model in a limited time, following the data science pipeline.
